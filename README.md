# VibeMetrics Instagram Dashboard for SIADS699_ss24_234

## Introduction

This is the submission by group 24 for their MADS capstone final project. It is a web application that leverages machine learning models for the purpose of Instagram social media analysis. We integrate a comment sentiment analyzer and hashtag recommender into a full-stack web application. We aim to provide end-users who may not have data science knowledge a way to use data science tools for guidance on their social media strategy.

This repo consists of 5 separate directories: a React web client, a Node.js backend web server, a Flask machine learning server, model training of the sentiment analyzer, and model training of the hashtag recommender.

## Getting Started

### Data Sources

1. The hashtag_rec portion of the project requires the HARRISON dataset from Park et al. A Google drive link to the dataset can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m3u0vVw-DzaVsQNvyW_PtbMKZjzEAsC2/view?usp=sharing)(link only available to University of Michigan accounts).

2. Unzip the folder and copy its contents to the preexisting empty HARRISON folder.

3. Download data_embeddings.txt and data_indices_split.json from their drive links (links only available to University of Michigan accounts).

4. The final HARRISON folder should consist of:

```
    instagram_dataset/
    data_embeddings.txt
    data_indices_split.json
    data_list.txt
    tag_list.txt
```
