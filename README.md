# VibeMetrics Instagram Dashboard for SIADS699_ss24_234

## Introduction

This is the submission by group 24 for their MADS capstone final project. It is a web application that leverages machine learning models for the purpose of Instagram social media analysis. We integrate a comment sentiment analyzer and hashtag recommender into a full-stack web application in the hopes of providing end-users insights into how their posts are received.

This repo consists of 5 separate directories: a React web client, a Node.js backend web server, a Flask machine learning server, model training of the sentiment analyzer, and model training of the hashtag recommender.
